## Abstract 
This paper presents the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing Connect Four, a popular two-player board game. The GUI incorporates three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Each level utilizes different algorithms and strategies to provide varying gameplay experiences. The implementation of the GUI aims to provide an interactive platform for users to play Connect Four against computer opponents of different skill levels.

## Introduction
Connect Four is a strategic board game that requires players to strategically drop colored tokens into a grid to connect a line of four tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. With its inherent complexity, Connect Four has been a subject of interest in the field of artificial intelligence, offering a challenging environment for developing intelligent gameplay algorithms. In this paper, we present the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing Connect Four. The GUI incorporates three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Each level utilizes different algorithms and strategies to provide a distinct gameplay experience. The easy level serves as an introductory level, where the computer opponent makes random moves. This level allows novice players to familiarize themselves with the game and its dynamics, without facing a strong strategic opponent. The medium level employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This algorithm explores the game tree to determine the optimal move by considering all possible future moves and their outcomes. By utilizing alpha-beta pruning, the search space is significantly reduced, leading to improved computational efficiency and more challenging gameplay. The hard level employs a combination of move evaluation, heuristics, and randomization to enhance gameplay. Move evaluation involves assigning values to potential moves based on their desirability, while heuristics guide decision-making by incorporating domain-specific knowledge. Randomization adds an element of unpredictability, making the computer opponent's moves more varied and challenging. Through the development of this GUI, players can now engage in Connect Four matches against computer opponents of different skill levels. The GUI not only provides an interactive platform for gameplay but also offers an opportunity to experience the varying degrees of difficulty and strategic decision-making involved in Connect Four.
